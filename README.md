## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher  
- `pip` (Python package installer)  
- API keys (if using external LLM services like OpenAI)  

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/personal-assistant.git
   cd personal-assistant

2. **Install Dependencies::**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Add your API Keys (in the .env file):**
    ```makefile
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

4. **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run personal_assistant.py

5. **Access the App:**
    - Open your browser and go to:
    [text](http://localhost:8501)

### üì¶ Dependencies

Install all dependencies using the requirements.txt. Below are some core libraries used:

- langchain
- streamlit
- openai
- dotenv (for managing environment variables) 

### üìù Usage

1. Draft Emails:
    Input the context or topic for the email, and the assistant will generate a well-formatted draft.

2. Create Study Plans:
    Provide subjects and time constraints, and the assistant will suggest a study plan.

3. Extract Action Points:
    Paste meeting notes or any document, and the assistant will extract actionable tasks.

4. Interactive Query Agent:
    Ask questions or provide a task request directly in the query box, and get an immediate response.

### ü§ñ How it Works
1. LangChain Framework:
    Manages workflows, conversation memory, and prompts for interacting with the LLMs.

2. Streamlit Frontend:
    Provides a real-time web interface for user interaction.

3. APIs and Models:
    Uses language models like OpenAI's GPT to generate responses, if configured.
